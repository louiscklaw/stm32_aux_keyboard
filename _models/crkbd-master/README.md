# crkbd x jian

This is a fork of the corne-chocolate PCB, with some small tweaks to its physical layout, as well as a custom-designed case and keycaps. All files can be found under the corne-jian/ subdirectory.

The PCB was edited in KiCAD 5. Following changes were made:
- change PCB edge shapes
- change choc switch footprints from hot-swap to PCB-mount
- change mounting holes locations & dimensions
- add 3D models for some components

The case and keycaps were designed in FreeCAD 0.17. The case has some holes for M2 inserts to be added, into which the PCB should then be screwed. The holes turned out to be slightly too large for my inserts, so I had to add some super glue. The keycaps work reasonably well given that they are FDM printed with PETG filament, but they wobble a bit in the switches and should probably be re-printed using resin in an SLA printer.

## Original variants

These are unchanged from foostan's original repo:
- corne-classic
- corne-cherry: Hotswappable corne for CherryMX switches by kailh PCB sockets.
- corne-chocolate: Hotswappable corne for Chocolate switches by kailh PCB sockets.
- corne-light: Lightweight corne(Easily build and Simply PCB).
